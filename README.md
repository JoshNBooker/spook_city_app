# spook_city_app
Edinburgh is a city steeped in history and folklore, with tales of ghosts and ghouls lurking in its dark alleyways and ancient buildings. Spook City aims to provide an immersive and entertaining way for both tourists and locals to experience the city's spooky legends.

This project utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Java, React Native, Viro, and Leaflet to create a seamless and captivating AR experience that combines real-world locations with virtual ghosts and storytelling.

This project is still early in development, and the Readme will be updated as we work on SpookCity, so check back soon!
