### spook_city_app
Edinburgh is a city steeped in history and folklore, with tales of ghosts and ghouls lurking in its dark alleyways and ancient buildings. Spook City aims to provide an immersive and entertaining way for both tourists and locals to experience the city's spooky legends.

This project utilizes cutting-edge technologies such as Java, React Native, Viro, and Leaflet to create a seamless and captivating AR experience that combines real-world locations with virtual ghosts and storytelling.

## To Run Spook City on an Simulator or using Expo Go

First, clone the repository. 

Once installed install the Client dependencies via CLI: 

```
cd Client
npm install
```

Seed the DB by running the application from the Server folder in your IDE. 

Then, return to the Client and you can run the app by using the following command in your terminal: 

```
npm expo start
```

It will deliver you a prompt with a QR code. If you have a mobile simulator already installed, press i for IOS, or a for an Andriod simulator. Otherwise, scan the QR code on your phone, which will take you to the Expo Go app. (NOTE: If you are running the app on your mobile using Expo Go, you must ensure both your computer and phone are on the same IP.)
